# Togather React Developer Code Assessment

## Overview

It is an admin tool that allows a user to control and preview the homefeed of a custom app. There are two types of elements that can be
added to the homefeed: To-doâ€™s and Call to Actions. Each element can be added many times each, and there is currently no way to add custom content to these.

### Packages Installed

- **SASS** (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a CSS pre-processor which has variables, mathematical operations, mixins, loops, functions, imports, and other interesting functionalities that make writing CSS much more powerful.
